//* loop i will start from 1 and iterate through n that is 4
//* First I will print spaces and then stars
//*  In the first row I have to print only one star and the rest will be spaces
//* I will use two loops the first will start from 1 till (n-i)
//* The second will start from 1 to (2*i-1)
//* When i = 1, 1st loop will print 3 spaces and the second loop will be 1 so one * star and three spaces will be printed and the loop continues
